            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Sin ripened like the pride of Gath, defies the Hoſt of the Lord of Hoſts, bathing the monſtrous ſpearhead of his rage, in the bloud of the choſen: how feeble hath the fall of <hi>Adam</hi> made his hapleſſe poſterity? the glorious Engliſh long clad in the victorious ſpoyles of that barbarous people, become the rebaters of their skeins, but not of their rage; finding now how dearly the Iſraelites paid for their cruell mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy in not extirpating the Idolatrous Canaanites, thoſe that policy left, for hewers of wood, and drawers of water, hew the fleſh, and draw the bloud of their maſters: thus humane policy is puniſht by inhumane impiety, teaching us that all the purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of fleſh and bloud, having not godlineſſe for their baſis, have ſandy foundations, and that policy without piety is a damnable diſcretion. The Dove and the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent ſhould like thoſe two kine of Bethſhemeſh at once be yoked to draw the Arke of God, from the poſſeſſion of the heathens to the people of God; or like <hi>Cleobis</hi> and <hi>Biton</hi> to draw their mother to the Temple: where obſerve the kine, and bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren were rewarded by death; the kine ſacrificed to the true God, the brethren to the falſe. O God, ſo bleſſe my pilgrimage that at my termination my laſt act may be beſt, that ſo I may like <hi>Manoahs</hi> ſacrifice aſcend up unto thee by an Ange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licall convoy.</p>
            <pb n="4" facs="tcp:155346:3"/>
            <p>Thoſe that ſacrificed up the calves of their lips, are now like beaſts ſacrificed. The rude reed runnes through the hand that ſuſtained it, whilſt the hoofes of unta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med and untaught monſters trample on thoſe heads that ſhod them; all alliance turning rebell either to civill, or legall contracts. Thoſe Nationall tyes held ſacred, and Gordian, of goſſip, or foſterer are denied by the brutiſh, to the Brittiſh <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zael</hi> and <hi>Zimri</hi> murthering their Maſters, the act not diſavowed, but countenanced, pardoned, and applauded by depicted <hi>Jezabel</hi> that Romiſh harlot. <hi>Solomons</hi> great ſacrifice at the Temples dedication was here outvied in number, but not nature, the Beaſt was not offered, but preſerved; for here the Miniſter was the chiefe ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, the Beaſt the ſacrificer.

            <p>Soone after, as all the Engliſh Inhabitants of that place often affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, Sir <hi>Con Magenis</hi> was by the ſtrange judgement of God, ſtrucken with a ſtrong frenzy, running home to his owne houſe on foot, the Lord taught him by the way, as Gideon taught the men of Succoth and Penu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el, his clothes and skin being juſtly torne by the buſhes and briers, in thoſe uncouth wayes his madneſſe made choyce of, raving on his death bed, Take away <hi>Tudge,</hi> take away <hi>Tudge,</hi> doe you not ſee how hee pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſues me for his bloud? in which deſperate condition he died.</p>
            <p>Thus God made this Rebell and mercileſſe beaſt, by the laſh of his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Juſtice, acknowledge his tranſgreſſion in taking away the lives of the innocent.

            <p>The firſt digreſſion is from the ſubject. With Mr. <hi>Fullerton</hi> was mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered Mr. <hi>Morgan Aubrey</hi> Eſquire, and his man (who though no Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter) I have thought good to mention in regard of thoſe many deare tyes of love and friendſhip between us, to whoſe diſaſtrous death I dedicate this tragick remembrance as a monument of his ſufferings, and my ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, a Gentleman of an active, brave, and Roman ſpirit, whoſe breaſt was not only filled with pleaſing flames of learned Poetry, but the more heroick fire of reſolution, ſweetly allayed with a modelt and wel tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red diſpoſition; a man that had merited as much from that laethe drinker
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:155346:11"/> Sir <hi>Phelomy O Neal,</hi> as a Gentleman could, having effectually negotiated for him in many particulars of conſequence with the late Lord <hi>Strafford,</hi> to whoſe Counteſſe he had been Gentleman uſher, yet was he all ingage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments waved, betraied by letters of ſafe conduct to a cruell and merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe but chery, firſt ſtripping him, then killing him at a bogs ſide. But en his ſervant <hi>Henry Lawrence</hi> (whom I have heard to be of a mighty ſtature and valour) a Warwickſhire man, who by ſurpriſing one of the Rebels ſwords, having ſlaine foure or five before he was ſeiſed on, was ſhewed that cruelty which was forborne to ravilliac the parricide of <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth, that <hi>Caelar</hi> of the the Flower <hi>du liz</hi> and was only exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed by <hi>Cambiſes</hi> upon one of his unjuſt judges whoſe skinne he flaied off, and nailed it to the tribunall, as a terrour to his ſonne that ſucceeded him, had but ſome of ours been made ſo exemplar, unjuſt votes had not laden our Kingdome with theſe bloudy conteſtations. The Judges of Iſrael rid on their white Aſſes, to ſhew I thinke as well their purity and innocency, as their patient undergoing the inſupportable weight of their callings; but it is feared ſome of them have not only caſt off that integri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, but purity and conſtancy alſo, this <hi>Laurence</hi> after many wounds re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, they flead ſome part of him, and ſo left him cruelly murdered.</p>
            <p>The ſecond digreſſion is from the Province, but ſomething adhering to the Subject. But above all barbarous, inhumane, hetheniſh, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard of murders, was that of Mrs. <hi>Smithſon</hi> a miniſters wife living at the Kilne of the Grange within foure miles of Dublin, who being perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to returne to her houſe, in hope to have the Communion cup, and a barrell of wheat given her, all which was promiſed by her ſatanicall ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducer, her poverty having made her too credulous, ſhe went along with her maid ſervant, no ſooner had they gotten this unfortunate Gentlewo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man in their power, but they ſtript her of her apparrell, ſetting her na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked a ſtride upon a leane jade, tying heavy weights at her heeles, then with ſtripes forced they the horſe to runne through waters, and leap o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ditches, and to travell in the moſt uneaſie paſſages till they brougt her into their army, that ſo they might not ſeeke for any other then Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſticall evidence of this their beſtiality; this uſage ſhe had untill her bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy was torne in a unheard of manner, feeding her with bread and water, which was rather affoarded to protract the miſeries they intended her then to preſerve or reprive a life, and when that her body could not any more be made a ſpectacle of their ſhame, ſhe was reſtrained, where firſt
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:155346:12"/> they cut off one eare, boyld it, and rubbed it about her mouth, then the other, after that her noſe, uſing them in the ſame manner, had <hi>Zopieus</hi> beene here to have ſeene this picture in her face, he would have declined his notable reſolution; at laſt they put out her eyes, and when they ſaw nature willing to eaſe her torments by diſſolution, and that mercifull death would ſet a period to their butcheries, they hanged her and her maid upon one bough, Her husband as before ſhe went having uſed all poſſible perſwaſions to keep her from going, ſo uſed all manner of dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence to procure her returne, after he perceived ſhee had outſtaied her intentions, bomplained to the State that ſhe was gone to Juſtice <hi>Wol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſtons,</hi> whoſe brother was then in Dublin (being both obſtinate Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts) who being ſent for to the State, and admoniſhed of their jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies of the womans miſcarriage, prevailed to be ſent thither for her deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very and reſtoration, but finding her paſt recover, deſerted Dublin, his eſtate which was great, and obedience which was little, and turned Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bell, which was no marvell; thus theſe cruell <hi>Benjamites</hi> for doubtleſſe they were ſo in that other act of unſeemlineſſe, did not abuſe the Concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bine, but the virtuous wife of a Levite, the ſtory of whoſe mangled and macerated carkaſſe I transfer to the eleven Tribes of our Engliſh Iſrael, knowing they will conclude, having ſeen this ſad and diſmall ſpectacle, as they did, <hi>Judges</hi> 19.30. And all that ſaw it, ſaid, there was no ſuch thing done nor ſeen ſince the time that the children of Iſrael came up from the land of Egypt unto this day.</p>
            <p>Conſider the matter, and conſult and give ſentence, then ſhall we all domeſtick inteſtines laid apart, joyne with Iſrael, to puniſh this damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and other facts of unpattern'd cruelty like them in the 20. of Judges 48. then ye men of Iſrael returned unto the children of <hi>Benjamin,</hi> and ſmote them with the edge of the ſword, from the men of the City unto the beaſts and all that came to hand: alſo they ſet on fire all the Cities that they could come by, moreover the men of Iſrael ſware in Mi<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>re have I floated in the blood and brine, of the tribe of <hi>Levie,</hi> a ſubject ſo terrible that I could not but mingle my incke with teares for whom I cloſe up to the tragicall diſcourſe with that lamentation of holy <hi>David</hi> for his friend <hi>Ionathan,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1.25.26. <hi>How were the mighty ſlaine in the midſt of the battell? O Ionathan thou waſt ſlaine in thine high places. Woe is me for thee my brother Ionathan: very kinde haſt thou been unto me; thy love to me was wonderfull, paſſing the love of women: how are the mighty men over-throwne, and the weapons of war deſtroyed.</hi>

            <p>This martirologer of part of that Miniſtery, I was the rather induced to publiſh, in regard ſome calumnious tongues have charged the Iriſh Engliſh Clergy to adhere to the Romiſh faction and fictions, which had they done they had ſaved their lives and eſtates, with the loſſe of their ſoules, but they with holy <hi>Philpot</hi> have ſealed their zeal to the Goſpel, by the effuſion of their blouds, confuſion of eſtates, taking a miſerable exile with <hi>Iohn</hi> to <hi>Pathmos,</hi> where I hope God will reveale himſelfe to them in their ſtraightneſſe to their comfort, and his glory, to whom be aſcribed all honour, and glory, now and for evermore, Amen.</p>
